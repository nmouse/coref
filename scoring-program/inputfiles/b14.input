<S ID="6">The rise in labor costs and wage settlements, which has been narrowing for most of the decade, leveled off last year, <COREF ID="X2">the Labor Department</COREF> said.</S>
<S ID="7"><COREF ID="X3">Total compensation costs in private industry, including pay and benefits,</COREF> rose 3.3% last year after a 3.2% increase in <COREF ID="X4">1986</COREF>, the department said.</S>
<S ID="8">The increase in these costs had been getting smaller each year since 1981, when they rose <COREF ID="X5">9.8%, </COREF>the same as in 1980.</S>
<S ID="9">Meanwhile, <COREF ID="X6">collective bargaining agreements reached last year</COREF> called for <COREF ID="X7">an average 2.2% wage increase in the first year of the contract</COREF> and 2.1% annually over <COREF ID="X8">the life of the pact</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="10">The industries surveyed agreed to the same percentage <COREF ID="X9">pay</COREF> raises when they last reached contract accords, the department said.</S>
<S ID="11"><COREF ID="X10">Officials</COREF> said it's the first time since 1982 that current contract settlements didn't provide lower average wage adjustments than the bargaining agreements they replaced.</S>
<S ID="12">The wage agreements reached last year also were higher than the average pay rises bargained in 1986, when a 1.2% increase in the first contract year and a 1.8% annual increase during the life of the settlements were the smallest increases recorded during the 20 years the Labor Department has collected the statistics.</S>
<S ID="13">Department officials said this year's higher wage increases don't necessarily indicate a trend.</S>
<S ID="14">A tighter <COREF ID="X11">labor</COREF> market in the services sector may be part of the reason the compensation increases have leveled off, officials said.</S>
<S ID="15">A tighter labor market would allow employees to demand higher pay and benefits.</S>
<S ID="16">In its report on major collective bargaining agreements, the department said that the average increase was reduced by <COREF ID="X12">lump-sum payments, which are one-time payments often made upon a contract's ratification</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="17">The payments often are provided instead of wage increases, but they aren't included in wages and aren't used as a base for future increases.</S>
<S ID="18">About half of the workers covered by big labor contracts last year received these payments.</S>
<S ID="19">Better-than-average wage settlements for <COREF ID="X13">construction industry</COREF> workers -- specifically those in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions -- were largely responsible for stopping the narrowing trend.</S>
<S ID="20">Construction pacts settled in 1987 averaged 2.9% increases in <COREF ID="X14">the first contract year</COREF> and 3.1% annually.</S>
<S ID="21">All other industries surveyed last year, including the automobile, food store and steel industries, averaged 2.1% increases in the first contract year and 1.9% annually.</S>
<S ID="22">About two million workers were covered by agreements reached last year.</S>
