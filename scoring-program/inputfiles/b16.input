<S ID="6">Chrysler Corp. this year will take the highly unusual step of setting up a formal grievance procedure for its non-union white-collar employees.</S>
<S ID="7">"We understand that (Chrysler's) dramatic restructuring .</S>
<S ID="8">.</S>
<S ID="9">.</S>
<S ID="10">will inevitably lead many employees to question management's decisions and actions," <COREF ID="X3">Anthony P. St. John</COREF>, vice president for human resources of the auto maker's Chrysler Motors subsidiary, said in a speech at Oakland University here yesterday.</S>
<S ID="11">"<COREF ID="X4">Employees</COREF> may not feel that they are being treated fairly."</S>
<S ID="12">To "strengthen management's credibility," Mr. St. John added, the company will set up an "alternative disputes resolution" system similar to a traditional union grievance procedure.</S>
<S ID="13">"For the first time <COREF ID="X5">these employees</COREF> will be guaranteed a formal and impartial internal mechanism to resolve discipline, discharge, and employment opportunity disputes>," Mr. St. John said.</S>
<S ID="14">The process will have several steps, concluding with final arbitration handled by a neutral third party.</S>
<S ID="15"><COREF ID="X6">Chrysler's move</COREF> apparently was inspired by the turmoil created by its current cost-cutting and restructuring, forces which are transforming many industrial companies.</S>
<S ID="16">The auto maker is significantly changing wage and benefit plans, and is trying to slash its white-collar rolls, particularly in the wake of its acquisition last year of American Motors Corp.</S>
<S ID="17">Chrysler has about 31,000 white-collar employees in the U.S., up sharply from roughly 21,000 in 1982.</S>
<S ID="18">About 6,000 salaried workers are currently represented by the <COREF ID="X7">United Auto Workers</COREF> union.</S>
<S ID="19">Some analysts speculated the move is designed to stave off further union organizing in the white-collar ranks.</S>
<S ID="20"><COREF ID="X8">Several management consultants</COREF> said a formal grievance procedure with third-party arbitration was common for government employees, but they had never heard of such a policy for non-union employees at a major private company.</S>
<S ID="21">"It has the potential of undermining supervisory and management responsibility and authority," said <COREF ID="X9">Jerrold Bratkovich</COREF>, a vice president in the Los Angeles office of the Hay Group, a management consulting firm.</S>
<S ID="22">"That's one of the main reasons employers don't want to have unionization."</S>
<S ID="23"><COREF ID="X10">A Chrysler spokesman</COREF> said the company had studied "a couple" of other companies that had arbitration for nonunion employees, but he couldn't recall which companies.</S>
<S ID="24">A more common business approach is the "open-door" policy such as that at <COREF ID="X11">International Business Machines Corp.</COREF>, where "any employee who has a problem which has not been resolved to satisfaction .</S>
<S ID="25">.</S>
<S ID="26">.</S>
<S ID="27">can bring the complaint to the attention of higher management," said <COREF ID="X12">an IBM spokesman</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="28">"If the employee is still not satisfied, the problem can be reviewed with the IBM chief executive officer," the spokesman added.</S>
<S ID="29">Chrysler will implement its system later this year.</S>
<S ID="30">The details haven't yet been worked out, Chrysler said.</S>
<S ID="31">According to a slide used in Mr. St. John's presentation, the policy would cover all "professional, administrative, management and executive employees."</S>
<S ID="32">It would also have a four-step grievance process, just as UAW-represented workers have.</S>
