<S ID="9">The Russian airline Aeroflot has been hit with <COREF ID="X4">a writ</COREF> for loss and damages, filed in <COREF ID="X5">Hong Kong</COREF> by the families of seven passengers killed in an air crash.</S>
<S ID="10">All 75 people on board <COREF ID="X6">the Aeroflot Airbus</COREF> died when it ploughed into a Siberian mountain in March 1994.</S>
<S ID="11"><COREF ID="X7">Aeroflot general manager for Hong Kong Vassili Tkatchenko</COREF> said on Tuesday he was unaware the writ had been filed.</S>
<S ID="12">The writ is for ``damages, interest and costs'' of seven passengers who died when the Moscow Airbus A310 flight bound for Hong Kong crashed at Novokuznetsk, Siberia.</S>
<S ID="13">It claims the deaths were ``caused by negligence, breach of statutory duty and breach of contract on the part of the defendant [Aeroflot].''</S>
<S ID="14">Air industry investigators say <COREF ID="X8">the 15-year-old son of Captain Yaroslav Kudrinsky</COREF> was flying the Hong Kong-bound aircraft after it left Moscow.</S>
<S ID="15">Black box transcripts show Eldar and <COREF ID="X9">Yana</COREF>, his 13-year-old sister, were in the cockpit prior to the crash.</S>
<S ID="16"><COREF ID="X10">Airline passengers</COREF> are protected under a section of the Warsaw Convention relating to air travel which was signed on October 12, 1929.</S>
<S ID="17">The liability of the carrier for death or personal injury to passengers has an upper limit of US$75,000.</S>
<S ID="18">But larger amounts have been awarded through the courts or through out-of-court settlements.</S>
<S ID="19"><COREF ID="X11">Aviation consultant Steve Miller</COREF>, the managing director of Trinity Aviation, said he was unaware of any aviation court settlements in Hong Kong.</S>
<S ID="20">``Taking it to the courts is very unusual for Hong Kong,'' Mr Miller said.</S>
<S ID="21">Six of the claims in the writs were filed by family members who live outside Hong Kong.</S>
