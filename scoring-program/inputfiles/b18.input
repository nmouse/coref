<S ID="5">After months of quiet and productive meetings, <COREF ID="X2">negotiators in the bitter labor battle at Eastern Airlines</COREF> are approaching a critical phase in the talks, a federal mediator said.</S>
<S ID="6">Harry Bickford, who has been supervising the talks in Miami, since last fall, said that representatives of the company and the International Association of Machinists have been meeting almost daily since January and have resolved hundreds of differences.</S>
<S ID="7">"<COREF ID="X3">We</COREF> are down to the point that within a short time we will be coming to terms with the gut issues," he said.</S>
<S ID="8">Mr. Bickford's comments are the first indication that progress has occurred in the high-stakes, 16-month confrontation over labor costs.</S>
<S ID="9"><COREF ID="X4">Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp.,</COREF> is seeking <COREF ID="X5">steep wage cuts from its roughly 10,000 machinists and baggage handlers</COREF> as part of a plan to restore the ailing carrier to profitability, and it has shrunk its capacity about 13% in the past year while seeking the cost concessions.</S>
<S ID="10">In an interview, Mr. Bickford acknowledged that the ever-growing clamor of public demonstrations, letter-writing campaigns and political lobbying have heightened antagonism at <COREF ID="X6">the bargaining table</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="11">"Litigation, charges, counter-charges -- I'm used to <COREF ID="X7">that</COREF>," said Mr. Bickford, an 18-year mediation veteran.</S>
<S ID="12">"But the extent to which it has gone in this case is unparalleled.</S>
<S ID="13">I have never faced anything like it."</S>
<S ID="14">Nevertheless, "We are still talking," Mr. Bickford asserted, "and have been every day since the 26th of January, with the exception of three periods totaling 10 days."</S>
<S ID="15">Mr. Bickford expressed anger at the growing perception that <COREF ID="X8">the mediation process</COREF> was fruitless and futile.</S>
<S ID="16">Last week, for instance, <COREF ID="X9">Florida Gov. Bob Martinez</COREF> issued a news release saying that "mediation has reached a stalemate and both sides should be allowed to return to the bargaining table."</S>
<S ID="17">And for their part, Eastern officials continue to lobby for <COREF ID="X10">the National Mediation Board</COREF> to impose a deadline on the talks, without which <COREF ID="X11">management</COREF> contends <COREF ID="X12">an agreement on a wage-concession package</COREF> is all but impossible.</S>
<S ID="18">Under U.S. labor law applying to airlines, the mediator may declare an impasse and begin a 30-day countdown, after which management may unilaterally impose its last contract offer and the union is free to strike.</S>
<S ID="19">"<COREF ID="X13">I</COREF> don't believe there is any prospect of getting a negotiated settlement," said Phil Bakes, president and chief executive officer of Eastern, "until there is a firm date when the existing contract comes to an end."</S>
<S ID="20"><COREF ID="X14">The union</COREF> says that it is bargaining seriously and that each side has made concessions.</S>
<S ID="21">A settlement through mediation is possible, "absolutely," said <COREF ID="X15">Charles Bryan, </COREF>head of the machinists' union at Eastern.</S>
<S ID="22">"I have never called <COREF ID="X16">a strike</COREF> at Eastern," he said.</S>
<S ID="23">Indeed, the Machinists union -- as well as <COREF ID="X17">the pilot</COREF> and flight attendant unions at Eastern, from whom management will also seek concessions in the coming months -- is anxious to avoid a strike.</S>
<S ID="24">Eastern has made elaborate preparations to keep the airline flying with non-union workers.</S>
<S ID="25">Even as talks continue under Mr. Bickford, neither side shows any sign of relenting in public.</S>
<S ID="26">Last week, Eastern ran newspaper advertising featuring <COREF ID="X18">Frank Borman, </COREF>the former astronaut and former Eastern president, saying the federal investigation of <COREF ID="X19">Texas Air</COREF> resulted from a <COREF ID="X20">union</COREF> "whisper campaign" alleging the airline is unsafe.</S>
<S ID="27">A week earlier, Eastern sued the Machinist and pilot unions, accusing them of a criminal conspiracy to drive down Texas Air's stock price.</S>
<S ID="28">Eastern and Texas Air are also urging employees and shareholders to write their members of Congress demanding that the National Mediation Board begin the 30-day countdown in the talks.</S>
<S ID="29">And Thursday, about 3,000 union members took part in a lunch-time demonstration in downtown Miami against Texas Air and Gov. Martinez.</S>
<S ID="30">Mr. Bickford said he was so upset by the level and tenor of the recent clamor, that the talks were moved for a period in April from Miami, where Eastern is based, to Boston, where he hoped things would be quieter.</S>
