<S ID="0">It is now broadly accepted that virulent <COREF ID="X0">APMV-1</COREF> viruses generally arise in <COREF ID="X1">poultry</COREF> by <COREF ID="X2">mutation</COREF> of <COREF ID="X3">viruses</COREF> of low <COREF ID="X4">virulence</COREF> after these viruses have been introduced into poultry <COREF ID="X5">flocks</COREF> (Alexander DJ, British Poultry Science 42, 5-22, 2001).</S>
<S ID="1">Since this <COREF ID="X6">ND</COREF> <COREF ID="X7">virus</COREF> reported from <COREF ID="X8">Victoria</COREF> is almost identical to the 1999 Mangrove Mountain isolate, then it appears more than a remote probability that the same precursor <COREF ID="X9">virus</COREF> (so-called Peat's Ridge strain) may have been present in these Victorian flocks for some time and a very similar mutation event has resulted in this virulent virus.</S>
<S ID="2">This raises further questions regarding the distribution of such precursor <COREF ID="X10">viruses</COREF> in <COREF ID="X11">Australia</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="3">For countries or regions claiming ND freedom, this outbreak again underlines the need for continuous serosurveillance of poultry flocks with immediate epidemiological investigation (including attempts to isolate and classify any APMV-1 viruses circulating) at the first sign of seroconversion in flocks.</S>
<S ID="4">[Newcastle disease <COREF ID="X12">virus</COREF> is a notoriously variable virus.</S>
<S ID="5"><COREF ID="X13">Strains</COREF> of Newcastle disease virus differ widely in virulence, depending on <COREF ID="X14">the cleavability</COREF> and activation of their hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and fusion membrane <COREF ID="X15">proteins</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="6">Avirulent strains produce inactive precursor proteins, whereas in virulent <COREF ID="X16">strains</COREF> the precursor proteins are cleaved and activated readily.</S>
<S ID="7">Since the spread of infection is dependent on cleavage occurring in the same <COREF ID="X17">tissue</COREF> in which replication occurs, the presence of specific cellular proteases as well as the inherent cleavability of the surface glycoprotein precursors determines the tissue tropism of virus strains and their ability to spread rapidly.</S>
<S ID="8"><COREF ID="X18">This</COREF> is the basis for the definition of strains of Newcastle disease virus as velogenic (or viscerotropic), mesogenic, or lentogenic for strains of high, intermediate, or low virulence, respectively.</S>
<S ID="9">A consequence of this is that the number of mutational steps between avirulence and high virulence may be quite small, and as Howard Pharo suggests, strains of high virulence could potentially arise independently from the same (or a closely related) precursor virus of low virulence.</S>
<S ID="10">Consequently, this should be taken into consideration in any disease surveillance programme.</S>
<S ID="11">A possible complicating factor, however, is that the source of the precursor viruses may not be domestic poultry.</S>
