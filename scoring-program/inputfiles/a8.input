<S ID="11">The Federal Aviation Administration underestimated the number of aircraft flying over the Pantex Weapons Plant outside <COREF ID="X7">Amarillo</COREF>, <COREF ID="X8">Texas</COREF>, where much of the nation's surplus plutonium is stored, according to computerized studies under way by the <COREF ID="X9">Energy Department</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="12">The FAA counted <COREF ID="X10">each flight</COREF> at <COREF ID="X11">Amarillo International Airport</COREF> once.</S>
<S ID="13">But <COREF ID="X12">military training planes</COREF> make up to 30 passes per flight over the plant, according to the <COREF ID="X13">Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="14">The secretary of Energy and local farmers have expressed concern that a plane crash into a plutonium storage bunker at Pantex could spread radioactive smoke for miles.</S>
<S ID="15">Plutonium, a highly radioactive element, causes cancer if inhaled.</S>
<S ID="16"><COREF ID="X14">The risk of that scenario</COREF>, previously estimated at one chance in 10 million, is expected to increase when current flight data are analyzed later this year, according to a safety board memo dated May 2.</S>
<S ID="17">``This doesn't surprise <COREF ID="X15">me</COREF> at all,'' said Trish Neusch, who farms <COREF ID="X16">land near the plant</COREF> 17 miles northeast of Amarillo and 7 miles from the airport.</S>
<S ID="18">``We are out there and see these planes all the time.''</S>
<S ID="19"><COREF ID="X17">Mike McNulty</COREF>, the FAA air traffic manager at Amarillo International, said <COREF ID="X18">the previous aircraft count</COREF>, conducted in late 1994, was a ``manual count on a pad,'' done informally by <COREF ID="X19">air traffic controllers</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="20">That 60-day accounting estimated that 25 planes a day entered <COREF ID="X20">flight patterns</COREF> over the zone where plutonium is stored in concrete bunkers covered with earth and grass.</S>
<S ID="21">Pantex is operated by the Energy Department through a private contractor and employs 3,600 workers, whose main mission is to dismantle nuclear warheads.</S>
<S ID="22">The hollow plutonium ball at the core of each weapon is stored at the former weapons assembly plant.</S>
<S ID="23">The Amarillo airport averages 250 takeoffs and landings per day, McNulty said.</S>
<S ID="24"><COREF ID="X21">About half the aircraft</COREF> are military planes assigned to Air Force bases in Texas, <COREF ID="X22">Oklahoma</COREF>, Kansas and New Mexico, he said.</S>
<S ID="25">About 25 percent of the airport traffic enters a flight pattern over the <COREF ID="X23">plutonium storage bunkers</COREF>, McNulty said.</S>
<S ID="26">For the past 14 months, air traffic controllers have tried to steer planes away from the bunkers, he said.</S>
<S ID="27">Two of the airport's dozen flight paths are directly above the nuclear storage area, McNulty said.</S>
<S ID="28">One approach will be eliminated by late summer or early fall when a new instrument landing system is installed, he said.</S>
<S ID="29">The second flight path cannot be altered until <COREF ID="X24">sophisticated equipment</COREF>, called VORTAC, is phased out at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport and installed in Amarillo, he said.</S>
<S ID="30">There is no target date for the transition.</S>
<S ID="31">McNulty downplayed the dangers posed by <COREF ID="X25">some military traffic</COREF> by noting that these planes often fly at high altitudes and stay 2 to 8 miles from the plutonium area.</S>
<S ID="32">``<COREF ID="X26">They</COREF> are counting something at 35,000 as well as 500 feet, when in actuality a plane would have to start falling in Oklahoma to hit the plant,'' McNulty said.</S>
<S ID="33">``They are just collecting a lot of raw data.''</S>
