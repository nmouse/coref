<S ID="8">By JONATHAN HILL and ADAM LEE in <COREF ID="X4">Macau</COREF> Two Chinese crew members</S>
<S ID="9">were killed <COREF ID="X5">Tuesday</COREF> when <COREF ID="X6">their helicopter</COREF> crashed near Macau.</S>
<S ID="10">The China Southern Helicopter Company aircraft was on its way to <COREF ID="X7">Zhuhai</COREF>, apparently returning from an oil rig, when it crashed, said a spokesman for <COREF ID="X8">Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="11">Other reports said the helicopter, which went down 10 to 15 nautical miles southeast of the Portuguese enclave, was gathering weather information.</S>
<S ID="12">The incident fell within Hong Kong airspace, triggering <COREF ID="X9">a search</COREF> by Civil Aviation Department rescuers.</S>
<S ID="13">Two Government Flying Service helicopters joined Macau Marine Police in the search for the Sikorsky 76.</S>
<S ID="14">Mainland authorities later told the department's Aeronautical Rescue Co-ordination Centre the wreckage had been recovered from <COREF ID="X10">the Chinese island</COREF> of Daiwaishan.</S>
<S ID="15">``Someone on the island heard a noise and called Zhuhai airport authorities,'' said a Macau aviation source.</S>
<S ID="16">``China sent a helicopter and confirmed the crash on the island.''</S>
<S ID="17">Macau authorities, who lost radar contact at 10 am, said the pilots had been found at the site ``and appeared dead''.</S>
<S ID="18">Zhuhai officials confirmed the crew had been killed.</S>
<S ID="19">Sources suggested that <COREF ID="X11">poor weather</COREF> was the likely cause of the crash.</S>
<S ID="20">The Royal Observatory reported strong winds in the area at the time.</S>
<S ID="21">Rescuers also reported poor visibility.</S>
<S ID="22">China, as the country of registration, would investigate the incident, the Civil Aviation Department said.</S>
