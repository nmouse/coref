<S ID="10"><COREF ID="X2">HALF MOON BAY</COREF>, Calif. Joe Reid, who died Thursday when <COREF ID="X3">the airplane</COREF> he was flying with 7-year-old <COREF ID="X4">Jessica Dubroff</COREF> and her father crashed in Cheyenne, Wyo., took up <COREF ID="X5">flying</COREF> the same way he did anything else: with passion and attention to detail.</S>
<S ID="11">``I respected his leadership, his thoroughness,'' said <COREF ID="X6">Gary Petersen</COREF>, manager of Half Moon Bay Airport.</S>
<S ID="12">``He was always capable and competent, a real by-the-book guy @amp;MD; very thorough, very detailed.''</S>
<S ID="13">Reid, 52, who for nearly 27 years was a broker at the Dean Witter Reynolds office in Palo Alto, was president of the Half Moon Bay Pilots Association.</S>
<S ID="14"><COREF ID="X7">George Auld</COREF>, a longtime friend who co-owned the aircraft that crashed, said he had first taken Reid up in a small plane in 1970.</S>
<S ID="15">He said Reid, a Vietnam veteran, got his pilot's license in the late 1970s and was certified to be an instructor about four years ago.</S>
<S ID="16">They bought the plane, a 1975 single-engine Cessna 177B Cardinal, about nine years ago.</S>
<S ID="17">``He loved flying and helping other people learn the excitement of flying,'' Auld said.</S>
<S ID="18">``Joe's not the type to do anything half way.''</S>
<S ID="19">Reid began giving lessons to Jessica about five months ago and was supportive of her effort to become the youngest person ever to make a round-trip, cross-country flight in the United States.</S>
<S ID="20">``I'm teaching her just like I would anybody else,'' he said.</S>
<S ID="21">``Mentally, she grasps the concepts as well as an adult.''</S>
<S ID="22">Forrest Storz, who also gives flying lessons at the airport, called Reid ``an exceptional, competent pilot. ''</S>
<S ID="23">Reid, who grew up in Kansas City, Mo., and was graduated from Saint Mary of the Plains College in Dodge City, Kan., was active in the Half Moon Bay community and serving a fourth term on the Coastside County Water District board.</S>
<S ID="24">He also was a member of the San Mateo County Airport Land Use Committee and was chairman of the annual Half Moon Bay Fly-In and Air Show.</S>
<S ID="25"><COREF ID="X8">He and his wife</COREF>, Ana, were active parishioners at Our Lady of the Pillar Catholic Church.</S>
<S ID="26">They had two sons, Christopher, 27, of Occidental, and Matthew, 23, of Half Moon Bay.</S>
