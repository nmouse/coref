<S ID="10">WASHINGTON @amp;MD; The Warsaw Convention governing the liability of an airline when passengers die in a plane crash is crumbling as <COREF ID="X3">airlines</COREF> try to raise the accord's <COREF ID="X4">$75,000 limit</COREF> on damages.</S>
<S ID="11">But prospects for a new agreement are uncertain, because the U.S. Department of Transportation is demanding that the accord provide that damage suits involving <COREF ID="X5">Americans</COREF> be heard in the <COREF ID="X6">United States</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="12">Some foreign airlines reject that demand.</S>
<S ID="13"><COREF ID="X7">This</COREF> is the third effort to raise the $75,000 limit, which was set in 1966 and which all parties agree is now far too low.</S>
<S ID="14"><COREF ID="X8">Efforts</COREF> in 1977 and 1988 would have raised the limit several-fold and were eagerly supported by <COREF ID="X9">U.S. officials</COREF>, but the United States did not approve them.</S>
<S ID="15">Trial lawyers said the higher limits were still too low, and <COREF ID="X10">aircraft manufacturers</COREF> feared high limits would encourage suits against them.</S>
<S ID="16">``The amount of time it's taking to do something rational is simply astonishing,'' said <COREF ID="X11">Jeffrey N. Shane</COREF>, an aviation lawyer who was assistant secretary of transportation for policy and international affairs from 1989 to 1993.</S>
<S ID="17">The Warsaw Convention, initiated in 1929 among 29 countries and joined by the United States in 1934, also governs who may sue and where, and details cargo rules.</S>
<S ID="18">All nations with commercial airlines have signed on, but the airlines agree that the document needs to be updated.</S>
<S ID="19">Because of the low liability limit, <COREF ID="X12">many airlines</COREF> are voluntarily paying more, either to spare themselves a lengthy trial at which <COREF ID="X13">families</COREF> will try to show negligence @amp;MD; which allows higher damages @amp;MD; or for general good will, or because they do not think the limits will hold up in court.</S>
<S ID="20"><COREF ID="X14">American Airlines</COREF>, for example, has told families of the people who died when one of its planes crashed in Colombia in December that it would negotiate as if the limit did not exist; it is doing the same for the 16 passengers on international trips who were on the American Eagle commuter flight that crashed in Roselawn, Ind., in October 1994.</S>
<S ID="21">``The message American is sending is, `We'll do what's fair, because we know a jury will do what's fairer,''' said <COREF ID="X15">Barry Lambert Harris</COREF>, who was an acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration in the Bush administration.</S>
<S ID="22">But the airlines would like a realistic limit and uniform system.</S>
<S ID="23">Representatives of airlines from around the world met this week in Montreal to try to work out the details of a system with no limits.</S>
<S ID="24"><COREF ID="X16">U.S. airlines</COREF> have received an antitrust exemption to negotiate an agreement, which would be subject to government approval.</S>
<S ID="25">The airlines and U.S. officials envision <COREF ID="X17">fairly simple negotiations</COREF> with families over ``<COREF ID="X18">economic damages</COREF>,'' the amount that the victim was likely to have earned over the remaining years of his or her life, given normal life expectancy.</S>
<S ID="26">The sticking point now is which court would resolve disputes if negotiations failed.</S>
<S ID="27">Under the current agreement, survivors can bring suit in the country the plane was flying to, the home country of <COREF ID="X19">the airline</COREF>, a country where the airline has its major operation or the country where the contract for transportation was written.</S>
<S ID="28">The United States wants <COREF ID="X20">a ``fifth jurisdiction''</COREF> for Americans: the United States.</S>
<S ID="29">Since domestic carriers are based here, they can already be sued here; adding the ``fifth jurisdiction'' would generally affect overseas carriers.</S>
