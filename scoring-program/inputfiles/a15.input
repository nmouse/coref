<S ID="10"><COREF ID="X6">DUBROVNIK</COREF>, Croatia @amp;MD; The coffins carrying the remains of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and 32 other Americans killed in a plane crash Wednesday were loaded onto <COREF ID="X7">two C-17 transport planes</COREF> that took off for Dover Air Force Base in Delaware after a somber farewell ceremony in Dubrovnik on <COREF ID="X8">Saturday</COREF> morning.</S>
<S ID="11">Croatian and American officials, flanked by 19 American and 19 Croatian honor guards, stood as the last four coffins, two covered with the American flag and two with the Croatian flag, were laid on the tarmac.</S>
<S ID="12"><COREF ID="X9">Two of those who died in the crash</COREF> were Croatian citizens.</S>
<S ID="13"><COREF ID="X10">President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia</COREF>, who spoke at the ceremony, said his nation was ``shaken by pain and sorrow.''</S>
<S ID="14">``Today when we take our leave from Ron Brown and all other senior <COREF ID="X11">U.S.</COREF> officials, on behalf of the whole of Croatia and myself, I express my deepest sympathy to <COREF ID="X12">the families of those who have perished</COREF>,'' Tudjman said.</S>
<S ID="15">``You will remain forever in our memory.''</S>
<S ID="16">He posthumously awarded Brown a high Croatian decoration.</S>
<S ID="17">In a brief euology, <COREF ID="X13">the American ambassador to Croatia</COREF>, Peter W. Galbraith, reminded those present that Saturday was Easter eve.</S>
<S ID="18">``As Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount,'' the ambassador said, ``blessed are <COREF ID="X14">the peacemakers</COREF>, for they shall be called the children of God.</S>
<S ID="19">Blessed indeed are <COREF ID="X15">our friends and colleagues</COREF> who perished on a mission of peace.''</S>
<S ID="20"><COREF ID="X16">The Air Force T-43 plane</COREF> slammed into <COREF ID="X17">a rocky hill named after St. John the Baptist</COREF> on Wednesday in heavy rain and fog.</S>
<S ID="21">The 35 passengers on board were killed, most instantly.</S>
<S ID="22"><COREF ID="X18">The two Croatians and Brown</COREF> are the only victims whose bodies have been identified.</S>
<S ID="23">The remaining bodies, many badly burned or mutilated, will be identified by forensic experts in the United States.</S>
<S ID="24">Galbraith said the most fitting memorial would be to make peace ``a reality on the ground'' and to offer ``a vastly better future to people who in the last five years have suffered so much.''</S>
<S ID="25">He called on <COREF ID="X19">Americans</COREF>, Croats and Bosnians to build the ``decent, honorable and wonderfully ordinary lives that we Americans too often take for granted.''</S>
<S ID="26"><COREF ID="X20">The Roman Catholic archbishop of Dubrovnik</COREF>, Zelimir Puljic, said a prayer and blessed the remains.</S>
<S ID="27">A bugler played taps before the planes taxied to the runway and lifted off in a clear sky for the 11-hour journey.</S>
<S ID="28"><COREF ID="X21">American investigators</COREF> continued to search the crash site Saturday and had cordoned off a debris-covered area with orange tape and also marked several pieces of wreckage with tape.</S>
<S ID="29">The investigating team that will try to determine the causes of the accident arrived in Dubrovnik on Saturday.</S>
<S ID="30">The white tail section of the plane, with the Stars and Stripes visible, and a few rows of attached passenger seats are the only large pieces left.</S>
<S ID="31">A long black burn mark outlined where the body of the aircraft probably had been.</S>
<S ID="32">Down the steep, rocky hillside lay part of the engine and a chunk of the fuselage.</S>
