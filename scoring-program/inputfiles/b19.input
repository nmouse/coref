<S ID="5">The United Steelworkers union agreed yesterday to open early contract talks Aug. 9 with the nation's two biggest aluminum makers.</S>
<S ID="6">Local presidents, meeting here, voted to begin the early bargaining in an effort to roll back concessions granted in <COREF ID="X4">1986</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="7"><COREF ID="X5">The current pacts with Aluminum Co. of America and Reynolds Metals Co.</COREF> expire next May 31, and any new accord would supersede that one.</S>
<S ID="8">"When we negotiated the current contracts in 1986, <COREF ID="X6">our members</COREF> made <COREF ID="X7">sacrifices to help the companies over hard times</COREF>," said <COREF ID="X8">George Becker, </COREF>the union's chief negotiator.</S>
<S ID="9">Since then, though, the aluminum industry has staged <COREF ID="X9">a strong recovery</COREF>, and Mr. Becker said union members expect to "share in those gains and recover the sacrifices they made."</S>
<S ID="10">Under normal circumstances, bargaining wouldn't have begun until next year.</S>
<S ID="11"><COREF ID="X10">Pittsburgh-based Alcoa</COREF> and <COREF ID="X11">Reynolds, Richmond, Va.,</COREF> have agreed to the early talks.</S>
<S ID="12">The <COREF ID="X12">union</COREF>'s action follows a similar decision Friday by the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers union, which bargains in concert with the Steelworkers.</S>
<S ID="13">Combined, the two unions represent about 21,000 Alcoa and Reynolds employees.</S>
