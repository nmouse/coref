<S ID="5">The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries appears to be pulling back from the brink of a possible price war.</S>
<S ID="6">After recent major <COREF ID="X4">price</COREF> declines because of <COREF ID="X5">a sharp rise in OPEC production</COREF>, total cartel output has now dropped as much as one million barrels <COREF ID="X6">a day</COREF> -- from the year's peak of <COREF ID="X7">20 million barrels a day early this month</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="7">And there are new indications that even the United Arab Emirates, OPEC's most notable quota violator, might soon cut <COREF ID="X8">its own output</COREF> below <COREF ID="X9">a targeted 1.5 million barrels a day</COREF> because of pressure from others in the cartel, including <COREF ID="X10">Saudi Arabia</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="8">The Emirates aren't making any promises publicly.</S>
<S ID="9">But <COREF ID="X11">its government</COREF> did offer <COREF ID="X12">conciliatory gestures to OPEC</COREF> <COREF ID="X13">yesterday</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="10">The gestures followed the arrival in <COREF ID="X14">Abu Dhabi</COREF> of <COREF ID="X15">OPEC's new secretary-general, </COREF>Subroto.</S>
<S ID="11">Mr. Subroto delivered a letter to <COREF ID="X16">Sheik Zayed Al Nahyyan, </COREF>the Emirates' ruler, from <COREF ID="X17">Rilwanu Lukman, </COREF>Nigeria's oil minister and OPEC's president, voicing concern over the Emirates' recent renunciation of <COREF ID="X18">its assigned quota of 948,000 barrels a day</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="12">The chief conciliatory note at <COREF ID="X19">the round of talks with Mr. Subroto</COREF> came from Sheik Zayed, who "reaffirmed" the Emirates' support for OPEC's "unity and cohesion. " According to <COREF ID="X20">the Emirates' official news agency</COREF>, the ruler also noted that his country "has always been at the forefront for boosting OPEC decisions and supporting the stability of the market."</S>
<S ID="13">The news agency report didn't mention the Emirates' production level.</S>
<S ID="14">But senior <COREF ID="X21">oil</COREF> officials in the Emirates were quoted by Dow Jones International Petroleum Report yesterday as saying that while the government isn't backing down on its demand for a higher OPEC quota, current production is well under the target.</S>
<S ID="15">Industry estimates generally place the Emirates' current production at between 1.2 million and 1.5 million barrels a day.</S>
<S ID="16">Until recently, <COREF ID="X22">such excess output by the Emirates</COREF> would have been ignored.</S>
<S ID="17">But it became an issue for OPEC -- as well as for <COREF ID="X23">the world oil markets</COREF> -- last month, when Emirates' officials went public with their intent to renounce their quota.</S>
<S ID="18"><COREF ID="X24">That</COREF> not only focused new attention on OPEC output, which had begun climbing in late June, as previously reported, but it also raised concern among <COREF ID="X25">other exporters</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="19">With Iraq also excluded from the system as a result of fallout from its war with Iran, "they are afraid that if the UAE continues outside there will be no control over the others," said Bahman Karbassioun, a Vienna-based consultant on OPEC affairs.</S>
<S ID="20">In addition to Mr. Subroto's visit to Abu Dhabi, OPEC's price-monitoring committee of five leading oil ministers also is tentatively scheduled to meet next Wednesday in Lausanne, Switzerland, to address the problem of the Emirates' unilateral quota decision, and to review world oil prices.</S>
<S ID="21">But OPEC's headquarters yesterday still declined to confirm details of <COREF ID="X26">the meeting</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="22">"It's tentative because it depends on the outcome of the talks in the UAE," said an OPEC spokesman.</S>
<S ID="23">Meanwhile, total OPEC output has dropped as much as 5% after the recent run-up -- with Saudi Arabia, the cartel's biggest producer, pacing the declines.</S>
<S ID="24">PetroLogistics Ltd., a Geneva-based consulting firm that closely monitors OPEC output, estimates production for July had averaged <COREF ID="X27">just over 19 million barrels a day</COREF> after reaching 20 million barrels a day in the first week of the month.</S>
<S ID="25">That's in line with demand for OPEC oil for the second half, according to a current report on world oil markets by <COREF ID="X28">Charles L. McSpadden, </COREF>manager of petroleum analysis, and <COREF ID="X29">Antonio M. Szabo, </COREF>manager of petroleum planning, at Bonner @amp; Moore Market Consultants, Houston.</S>
<S ID="26">"The 19 million barrels a day is in OPEC's comfort zone," said Mr. Szabo.</S>
