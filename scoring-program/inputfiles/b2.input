<S ID="10">Amr corp.'s American Airlines unit said it has called for federal mediation in its contract talks with unions representing its <COREF ID="X2">pilots</COREF> and <COREF ID="X3">flight attendants</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="11">A spokesman for the company said American officials "felt talks had reached a point where mediation would be helpful."</S>
<S ID="12">Negotiations with the pilots have been going on for 11 months; talks with flight attendants began six months ago.</S>
<S ID="13"><COREF ID="X4">The president</COREF> of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents American's more than 10,000 flight attendants, called <COREF ID="X5">the request for mediation</COREF> "premature" and characterized it as a bargaining tactic that could lead to a lockout.</S>
<S ID="14">Patt gibbs, president of the association, said <COREF ID="X6">talks with the company</COREF> seemed to be progressing well and the call for mediation came as a surprise.</S>
<S ID="15"><COREF ID="X7">The major outstanding</COREF> issue in the negotiations with the flight attendants is a two-tier wage scale, in which recent employees' salaries increase on a different scale than the salaries of employees who have worked at american for a longer time.</S>
<S ID="16"><COREF ID="X8">The union</COREF> wants to narrow the differences between the new scale and the old one.</S>
<S ID="17">The company declined to comment on the negotiations or the outstanding issues.</S>
<S ID="18">Representatives for the 5,400-member Allied Pilots Association didn't return phone calls.</S>
<S ID="19">Under the Federal Railway Labor Act, if the mediator fails to bring <COREF ID="X9">the two sides</COREF> together and the two sides don't agree to binding arbitration, <COREF ID="X10">a 30-day cooling-off period</COREF> follows.</S>
<S ID="20">After that, <COREF ID="X11">the union</COREF> can strike or the company can lock the union out.</S>
<S ID="21">Ms. Gibbs said that in response to the company's move, her union will be "escalating" its "corporate campaign" against American over the next couple of months.</S>
<S ID="22">In <COREF ID="X12">a corporate campaign</COREF>, <COREF ID="X13">a union</COREF> tries to get <COREF ID="X14">a company</COREF>'s financiers, investors, directors and other financial partners to pressure the company to meet union demands.</S>
<S ID="23">A corporate campaign, she said, appeals to her members because "it is a nice, clean way to take a job action, and our women are hired to be nice."</S>
<S ID="24">the union has decided not to strike, she said.</S>
<S ID="25">The union has hired a number of professional consultants in its battle with the company, including <COREF ID="X15">Ray Rogers of Corporate Campaign Inc.</COREF>, the New York labor consultant who developed the strategy at <COREF ID="X16">Geo. A. Hormel @amp; Co.</COREF>'s Austin, Minn., meatpacking plant last year.</S>
<S ID="26">That campaign, which included a strike, faltered when the company hired new workers and the International Meatpacking Union wrested control of the local union from Rogers' supporters.</S>
