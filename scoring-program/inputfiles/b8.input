<S ID="13"><COREF ID="X6">Striking auto workers</COREF> and <COREF ID="X7">Chrysler Corp.'s Canadian unit</COREF> appeared to be making progress in <COREF ID="X8">negotiations</COREF> <COREF ID="X9">yesterday</COREF>, as the company said it planned to make a new contract offer by this morning.</S>
<S ID="14">Meanwhile, in Dearborn, Mich., <COREF ID="X10">Ford Motor Co.</COREF> and <COREF ID="X11">the United Auto Workers union</COREF> continued negotiations into the evening yesterday, but neither side would officially discuss progress.</S>
<S ID="15">Early in the day, bargaining committee members had reported to their union locals that <COREF ID="X12">a settlement</COREF> was imminent.</S>
<S ID="16">Still, negotiations dragged on.</S>
<S ID="17">Late last night union officials were still hoping to announce a settlement by early this morning.</S>
<S ID="18"><COREF ID="X13">UAW President Owen Bieber</COREF> was absent from the talks all day.</S>
<S ID="19">The 57-year-old union leader checked into Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit <COREF ID="X14">Tuesday</COREF> night for testing because of abdominal pain, <COREF ID="X15">one source</COREF> said.</S>
<S ID="20">The tests ruled out any heart problems, and Mr. Bieber was apparently in "good condition," the source said.</S>
<S ID="21">He added that Mr. Bieber's hospitalization doesn't affect the pace of negotiations.</S>
<S ID="22">A UAW spokesman would neither confirm nor deny the report.</S>
<S ID="23">In Toronto, <COREF ID="X16">Robert White, </COREF>president of the Canadian Auto Workers union, said he expects the new offer from Chrysler Canada Ltd. to contain <COREF ID="X17">sweetened cost-of-living adjustments for pensioners</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="24"><COREF ID="X18">The Canadian union</COREF> has made inflation-indexed pension payments its top priority in the talks.</S>
<S ID="25">Mr. White said negotiators "unlocked the logjam on <COREF ID="X19">the main issue</COREF>" after all-night meetings Tuesday and yesterday.</S>
<S ID="26">The union struck Chrysler Canada Tuesday after rejecting a company offer on <COREF ID="X20">pension adjustments</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="27">The union said the size of the adjustments was inadequate.</S>
<S ID="28">But <COREF ID="X21">Chrysler Canada's chief negotiator, </COREF>William Fisher, said yesterday that <COREF ID="X22">the two sides</COREF> had reached "some understandings" on economic issues, including pensions.</S>
<S ID="29">"We have a good chance of wrapping something up by the end of the week," he said.</S>
<S ID="30">Mr. White allowed negotiations on <COREF ID="X23">local issues</COREF> to resume yesterday.</S>
<S ID="31">About 200 local issues that remain unsettled had been suspended while the CAW and Chrysler grappled with the pension issue.</S>
<S ID="32">If a settlement comes today or tomorrow, Chrysler's 10,000 Canadian workers could vote on a contract this weekend, when the union has scheduled membership meetings for the striking workers.</S>
<S ID="33">Chrysler said its four Canadian plants could resume production Monday if a new pact is accepted.</S>
<S ID="34">A company spokesman said about 2,285 workers remain on layoff at two <COREF ID="X24">U.S.</COREF> plants as a result of the Canadian strike.</S>
<S ID="35">As previously reported, Chrysler stopped output of Dodge Dynasty and Chrysler New Yorker cars yesterday at its Belvidere, Ill., plant because of a shortage of Canadian-made parts.</S>
<S ID="36">Some 1,700 of the plant's 2,900 hourly employees were laid off as a result.</S>
<S ID="37">Also, <COREF ID="X25">about 585 workers</COREF> were laid off at <COREF ID="X26">a stamping plant near Detroit</COREF> because the parts they make aren't needed in Canada during the strike.</S>
<S ID="38">That plant normally employs 2,800 hourly workers.</S>
<S ID="39">The CAW's contracts with Chrysler and the Canadian units of <COREF ID="X27">General Motors Corp.</COREF> and Ford Motor Co. expired <COREF ID="X28">Monday</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="40">Talks with GM and Ford are on hold pending the outcome of the Chrysler talks.</S>
<S ID="41">In the Ford-UAW talks, <COREF ID="X29">the two parties</COREF> turned to economics yesterday in addition to <COREF ID="X30">the job-security issue</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="42">Sources said Ford expressed willingness to offer some sort of base-wage raise, or annual improvement factor, but it wasn't clear how much or for how many years.</S>
<S ID="43">In <COREF ID="X31">the previous contract</COREF>, the company made lump-sum payments instead of base-wage raises in two of the three years.</S>
<S ID="44">It offered no base-wage raises in its initial proposal this year.</S>
<S ID="45">On the job-security issue, it is understood that Ford agreed not to lay off any workers during the life of the contract except during a major sales plunge.</S>
<S ID="46">The company also promised to replace half of all workers leaving the company.</S>
<S ID="47">At last report, the two sides were still haggling over details of the job-security plan, while also discussing the wage and benefit package.</S>
<S ID="48">The contract expired at midnight Monday, but the union, citing progress, agreed to an indefinite extension.</S>
<S ID="49">The UAW's contract with GM also expired Monday, but negotiations with the No. 1 auto maker were postponed pending a settlement with Ford.</S>
<S ID="50">Chrysler's U.S. contract doesn't expire until next year.</S>
<S ID="51">Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Chrysler closed at $42.25, down $1.</S>
<S ID="52">Ford closed at $104, down 62.5 cents.</S>
