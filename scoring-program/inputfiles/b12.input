<S ID="7">Communications Satellite Corp., Washington, said it submitted to the Federal Communications Commission a proposal to reduce by 50% rates for certain international telecommunication services.</S>
<S ID="8">In exchange for <COREF ID="X1">the reductions</COREF>, customers such as <COREF ID="X2">American Telephone @amp; Telegraph Co.</COREF> would have to commit themselves to using one of <COREF ID="X3">two new types of digital satellite services</COREF> for a 10-year period, Comsat said.</S>
<S ID="9">The proposal is part of a multi-year agreement between Comsat and AT@amp;T that guarantees Comsat a portion of the telephone company's international business in the face of growing competition from fiber-optic cables.</S>
<S ID="10">Comsat said AT@amp;T and other customers would be able to convert gradually to the new digital service beginning next year, and that by 1994, as much as 83% of a customer's international circuits could qualify for the price reductions.</S>
<S ID="11">Digital service allows telecommunications customers to subdivide satellite circuits to handle more than one message at a time, Comsat said.</S>
