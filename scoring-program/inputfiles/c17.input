<S ID="0">The <COREF ID="X0">ProMED</COREF> <COREF ID="X1">posting</COREF> dated 10 May 2003, "<COREF ID="X2">Psittacosis</COREF>, birds - Australia (NSW)20030509.1157," had <COREF ID="X3">one significant misleading fact and a few questionable elements</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="1"><COREF ID="X4">I</COREF> realize <COREF ID="X5">the source</COREF> was a local newspaper, and therefore it is important to address some of the less accurate elements of this report.</S>
<S ID="2">It was stated that the disease is not transferred from person to person.</S>
<S ID="3">While person-to-person <COREF ID="X6">transmission</COREF> of the organisms is not common, it has been reported over the years.</S>
<S ID="4">Person-to-person spread of the disease does occur, as is evident from the 1943 Louisiana outbreak, when a single fatal human case gave rise to 18 additional human cases among nursing attendants at the hospital.</S>
<S ID="5">Interhuman transmission of psittacosis was also reported by Hansen et al.</S>
<S ID="6">in the Danish Med Bul.</S>
<S ID="7">1955 Vol 2 page 51.</S>
<S ID="8">It is correct that *experimental* hosts of this disease can include all <COREF ID="X7">species</COREF> of birds; however, it is important to distinguish between experimental disease transmission and natural occurrence of the disease.</S>
<S ID="9">I would therefore question the claim that "all birds are susceptible to the infection."</S>
<S ID="10">The response of different species of birds is not uniform, and <COREF ID="X8">some</COREF> are highly resistant to the disease.</S>
<S ID="11">In some species of birds the disease has never been reported.</S>
<S ID="12">Highly resistant species of birds do not impose the same human health risk, because they either do not shed <COREF ID="X9">the organism</COREF> or harbour only a small number of these bacteria.</S>
<S ID="13">While the <COREF ID="X10">time</COREF> from exposure to development of symptoms is usually 4-14 days as stated in the article, longer incubation periods (up to 4 weeks) have been reported in humans in the literature.</S>
<S ID="14">It is important to be accurate and to keep an open mind about all aspects of disease reporting, especially in cases where the disease is of significance to human health and the source is a local newspaper.</S>
<S ID="15">[ProMED thanks Dr Arzey for these clarifications.</S>
<S ID="16">In 1929-30 a pandemic of psittacosis spread to 12 countries, causing approx.</S>
<S ID="17">1000 cases &amp; 200-300 deaths (Schachter 1975, in Hubbert et al.(eds.)</S>
<S ID="18">Diseases transmitted from animals to man, 6th ed., Thomas, Springfield IL.</S>
<S ID="19">), linked to the importation of psittacines from South America, but it is not clear if any of these were due to human- to-human transmission.</S>
<S ID="20">With only 2 reports in 60 years quoted above, this is probably not a common occurrence.</S>
<S ID="21">Nowadays, in the USA, the human disease is mainly associated with working with turkeys, and in central &amp; eastern Europe, with ducks.</S>
