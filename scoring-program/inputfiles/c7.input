<S ID="1">Closed by Suspected <COREF ID="X1">Outbreak</COREF> of <COREF ID="X2">Winter Vomiting Disease</COREF> -------------------------------------------------- .</S>
<S ID="2">An outbreak of what is suspected to be winter vomiting disease forced the closure of <COREF ID="X3">Sunnybrook Hospital</COREF>'s emergency department on <COREF ID="X4">Monday</COREF> morning.</S>
<S ID="3">Over the weekend, a number of <COREF ID="X5">patients</COREF> and <COREF ID="X6">staff</COREF> were stricken by bouts of <COREF ID="X7">vomiting</COREF> and diarrhea.</S>
<S ID="4">By Monday afternoon 25 Nov 2002, 28 staff members and 13 patients showed <COREF ID="X8">symptoms</COREF> of <COREF ID="X9">the virus</COREF> <COREF ID="X10">infection</COREF>, which is highly contagious and spread through person-to-person contact.</S>
<S ID="5">"<COREF ID="X11">We</COREF> haven't determined what the infection is yet.</S>
<S ID="6">We suspect it to be a case of something called winter vomiting disease," hospital spokesman <COREF ID="X12">Craig DuHamel</COREF> said.</S>
<S ID="7">"Obviously we have to be very vigilant to ensure this is contained in our emergency department."</S>
<S ID="8">The emergency department was expected to be closed until the afternoon of <COREF ID="X13">Wed</COREF> 27 Nov 2002 at least, DuHamel said, adding that cleaning crews were on the scene with anti-viral agents [disinfectants?].</S>
<S ID="9">Patients walking into emergency were told about the situation upon arrival and, if their condition was stable, asked to go to another <COREF ID="X14">hospital</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="10">Those who were unable to go to another facility would be treated, the hospital said in a news release.</S>
<S ID="11">Winter vomiting disease is an infection caused by <COREF ID="X15">a virus</COREF> commonly transmitted from person to person in cold weather, when people are indoors more often and in closer contact.</S>
<S ID="12">Symptoms include severe nausea and vomiting that can last between 24 and 48 hours.</S>
<S ID="13">DuHamel said the virus is not life-threatening and is similar to the <COREF ID="X16">Norwalk</COREF> virus, which has made headlines recently for sickening hundreds of passengers on the Florida-based cruise ship Amsterdam.</S>
<S ID="14">[As has been repeatedly stated in <COREF ID="X17">ProMED-mail</COREF>, "winter vomiting disease" is a misnomer.</S>
<S ID="15">Outbreaks in the UK and Ireland have occurred throughout the year in hospitals, health care facilities, and schools.</S>
<S ID="16">In North America outbreaks on cruise ships have occurred during voyages to Alaska in the summer and to Caribbean destinations in the winter.</S>
<S ID="17">Density and hygiene considerations are probably the relevant determining factors.</S>
<S ID="18">Winter vomiting disease is caused by <COREF ID="X18">infection</COREF> with a Norwalk-like virus, although this is seldom confirmed microbiologically.</S>
<S ID="19">Norwalk-like viruses are a heterogenous group of caliciviruses that is now designated as the genus _Norovirus_.</S>
