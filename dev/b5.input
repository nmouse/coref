<S ID="7"><COREF ID="X2">I</COREF> was pleased to see <COREF ID="X3">your May 5 article</COREF>, "<COREF ID="X4">Farm-Debt Mediation</COREF> Catches On in Iowa."</S>
<S ID="8">Farm-debt mediation is, indeed, a Farm Belt success story in the midst of <COREF ID="X5">the most devastating crash in the farm economy since the Great Depression</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="9">I am compelled, however, to comment on your evaluation of <COREF ID="X6">Minnesota's mediation program</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="10">While Minnesota's program has met some resistance from <COREF ID="X7">creditors</COREF>, it nonetheless has been a solid success.</S>
<S ID="11">As of April 24, there were 3,864 mediations that either have been completed or were in progress.</S>
<S ID="12">Of the 2,939 completed mediations, 1,393 -- or 46% -- resulted in an agreement.</S>
<S ID="13">It is clear from these figures that despite the naysayers, Minnesota mediation works.</S>
<S ID="14">It helps keep <COREF ID="X8">farmers</COREF> on the land and creditors in business.</S>
<S ID="15">Most important, as <COREF ID="X9">the University of Minnesota</COREF> found when it evaluated the program last winter, mediation has reduced significantly the threat of violence in rural areas.</S>
<S ID="16">Moreover, recent data indicate that mediation is a viable alternative to bankruptcy.</S>
<S ID="17">An analysis completed by the Center for Rural Affairs indicates that states with mediation have had proportionately fewer <COREF ID="X10">Chapter 12</COREF> bankruptcy filings.</S>
<S ID="18">Of the six Midwestern states surveyed, Minnesota had the fewest Chapter 12 filings per 1,000 farmers.</S>
<S ID="19">As your article notes, the Minnesota Legislature is considering <COREF ID="X11">various amendments to the Mediation Act</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="20">However, the proposed amendments are not the result of "mediation-bashing," as the article suggests.</S>
<S ID="21">Rather, they are the result of a growing consensus that mediation works and should be improved in order to ensure it works even better.</S>
<S ID="22"><COREF ID="X12">The program's record</COREF> speaks for itself.</S>
<S ID="23">It demonstrates that farmers and lenders can work together to solve the challenge created by the continuing crisis in our nation's rural economy.</S>
