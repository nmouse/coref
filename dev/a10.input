<S ID="10">WASHINGTON @amp;MD; The Navy suspended operations for its <COREF ID="X4">entire fleet of F-14 airplanes</COREF> <COREF ID="X5">Thursday</COREF> after the third ``Tomcat'' crash in a month @amp;MD; the second in a week.</S>
<S ID="11"><COREF ID="X6">The 72-hour ``safety stand-down''</COREF> came shortly after <COREF ID="X7">an F-14 fighter</COREF> from the USS Nimitz crashed during flight operations in the northern Persian Gulf at about 6:30 a.m. EST.</S>
<S ID="12">The Navy announced that <COREF ID="X8">the two Naval aviators on board</COREF> were rescued by a SH-60 helicopter after they ejected from the aircraft.</S>
<S ID="13">The Navy said that both men were in good condition.</S>
<S ID="14">One aviator suffered minor abrasions.</S>
<S ID="15">The Navy is investigating the cause.</S>
<S ID="16">Another Tomcat crashed off the coast of California during exercises on the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson on Sunday.</S>
<S ID="17">Both crew members were killed.</S>
<S ID="18">Late last month, an F-14 crashed near Nashville, killing both crew members and three civilians on the ground.</S>
<S ID="19">Although the crash Thursday was the third Tomcat crash this year, <COREF ID="X9">Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon</COREF> said the Navy had uncovered no evidence of a flaw in the aircraft.</S>
<S ID="20"><COREF ID="X10">A safety stand-down</COREF> is a procedure the military uses to conduct an intensive review.</S>
<S ID="21">During this three-day period, the three classes of F-14s will stay out of the air so Navy personnel can review maintenance procedures and equipment, plus check each aircraft for weaknesses or deficiencies.</S>
<S ID="22">The F-14s on the deck of <COREF ID="X11">the USS America</COREF> will be allowed to fly off because the aircraft carrier is returning from a deployment.</S>
<S ID="23"><COREF ID="X12">Carrier</COREF> decks are routinely cleared of aircraft the day before the carrier docks.</S>
<S ID="24">``We do not know what has caused <COREF ID="X13">these three crashes this year</COREF>,'' Bacon said.</S>
<S ID="25">``The goal of the stand-down is to take a time out to look at everything involved with the F-14s.</S>
<S ID="26"><COREF ID="X14">Adm. Jeremy Boorda</COREF>, the chief of Naval Operations, informed <COREF ID="X15">Deputy Defense Secretary John White</COREF> of the latest crash Thursday morning and told him he was ordering the standdown for the entire fleet of more than 300 aircraft, Bacon said.</S>
<S ID="27">``What the Navy is trying to do is find out what caused these accidents,'' Bacon said.</S>
<S ID="28">In the past five years, 32 F-14s have crashed.</S>
<S ID="29"><COREF ID="X16">One</COREF> of the Navy's first female pilots, Lt. Kara Hultgren, died while trying to land an F-14 on an aircraft carrier in 1994.</S>
<S ID="30">The Navy concluded that engine failure caused that crash.</S>
<S ID="31">The Tomcat, a $38 million, twin-engine aircraft built by the Grumman Aerospace Corp., is the standard fighter plane used by the Navy for close-in air combat.</S>
<S ID="32">The aircraft has been in operation since 1973.</S>
<S ID="33"><COREF ID="X17">The oldest version of the aircraft</COREF>, the F-14A, is scheduled to be phased out by the year 2004.</S>
<S ID="34">The crash rate for the F-14 dropped dramatically after <COREF ID="X18">the initial years of deployment</COREF> and has generally gone down since then except for occasional spurts of accidents, according to Naval records.</S>
<S ID="35">Bacon said the Navy had no single explanation for the increases in F-14 accidents.</S>
<S ID="36">``The Navy informs me that they have been unable to find a common thread to these accidents,'' Bacon said.</S>
<S ID="37">``<COREF ID="X19">This</COREF> is a mystery.''</S>
