<S ID="0">These curious rashes among American school children without any signs of systemic illness remind <COREF ID="X0">me</COREF> of a similar <COREF ID="X1">outbreak</COREF> with <COREF ID="X2">hundreds</COREF> of people in <COREF ID="X3">Western Berlin</COREF>, Germany, during the early <COREF ID="X4">sixties</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="1">At this time I was working as a young doctor in the <COREF ID="X5">Department of Infectious Diseases</COREF> in the Rudolf Virchow Hospital.</S>
<S ID="2">At first <COREF ID="X6">we</COREF> had no idea concerning the etiology.</S>
<S ID="3">Since our department was in charge of the management of the sick, we started to consider the hypothesis of an unknown <COREF ID="X7">virus</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="4">To our own surprise, a distinguished virological institute claimed to have isolated such a virus (the details I cannot remember) from the material of some patients.</S>
<S ID="5">It took about a week until we and our colleagues from the Department of Health found out that the disease was caused by a nutritive allergen.</S>
<S ID="6">A big food company had just added a new emulsifier to a <COREF ID="X8">brand</COREF> of margarine that was only sold in the western part of Berlin (at that time still separate).</S>
<S ID="7">After that lot had been taken from the market, the problem resolved immediately.</S>
<S ID="8">[Thank you Dr. Volkmer for this very interesting and thought-provoking account of a similar type rash illness outbreak.</S>
<S ID="9">It would be of interest to know if a possible food allergen might be the culprit in some or all of these current outbreak <COREF ID="X9">occurrences</COREF> -- perhaps a common food preparation product distributed to schools for use in school lunch programs.</S>
<S ID="10">Reviewing the details of the individual state outbreaks, some of the outbreaks seem to have more of a contact dermatitis picture, suggesting an environmental irritant, but the possibility of a common "food irritant" as described by Dr. Volkmer remains very intriguing.</S>
<S ID="11">We await further information on these outbreaks.</S>
