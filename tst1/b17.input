<S ID="6">President Reagan acknowledged that there is little chance he and <COREF ID="X4">Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev</COREF> will sign a strategic arms agreement at their summit in Moscow later this month.</S>
<S ID="7">In answering questions from members of the National Strategy Forum here, Mr. Reagan said it is "doubtful" that a strategic arms reduction, or START, treaty could be wrapped up in time.</S>
<S ID="8">Administration aides have been saying for weeks that there are far too many disagreements remaining for a treaty to be wrapped up, but Mr. Reagan's remarks represented his bluntest public assessment so far.</S>
<S ID="9">Mr. Reagan said that both he and Mr. Gorbachev hope that <COREF ID="X5">an agreement eliminating intermediate-range nuclear missiles, signed at a summit meeting in Washington last December</COREF>, will be ratified by the Senate in time for the Moscow summit.</S>
<S ID="10">But then he added: "<COREF ID="X6">Our</COREF> desire that we would be able to sign a START treaty at this Moscow summit, as we did the other one at the Washington summit, may not happen."</S>
<S ID="11">Mr. Reagan insisted that if <COREF ID="X7">such a treaty</COREF> is ever completed, it would have to produce "parity" in U.S. and Soviet strategic arsenals.</S>
