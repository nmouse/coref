<S ID="1">There has been another probable <COREF ID="X4">case</COREF> of Lassa fever in <COREF ID="X5">Freetown</COREF>, unrelated to the four cases (and four deaths) reported earlier.</S>
<S ID="2">A 21 year old male <COREF ID="X6">member</COREF> of the Indian contingent of UNAMSIL peacekeeping forces stationed in Daru, Kailahun District presented with fever on about 10 July 2000.</S>
<S ID="3">He was treated presumptively for <COREF ID="X7">malaria</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="4">Subsequently malaria and typhoid were ruled out by laboratory tests.</S>
<S ID="5">He was acutely ill, with <COREF ID="X8">temperatures</COREF> up to 41 C. Lassa fever was suspected, and he was transported to the UNAMSIL referral hospital in Freetown, where he has been maintained in strict isolation, with careful precautions in handling of blood and body fluids.</S>
<S ID="6">He developed phayrngitis, facial and pharyngeal edema and erythema, and bleeding and ecchymoses at venipuncture sites.</S>
<S ID="7">He was started on IV ribavirin.</S>
<S ID="8">On Day 3 of treatment, his temperature has come down and he is objectively and subjectively much improved.</S>
<S ID="9">He continues to have albuminuria, but no evidence of renal, hepatic or pulmonary failure.</S>
<S ID="10">Prothrombin times remain moderately elevated.This patient was very well managed by the UNAMSIL medical services in Daru and Freetown.All contacts are being followed with temperatures recorded twice daily.</S>
<S ID="11">UNAMSIL's preventive medicine officer is traveling to Daru to assess conditions at the UNAMSIL camp, including food security and rodent control.Some conclusions can be drawn.</S>
<S ID="12"><COREF ID="X9">We</COREF> have now had a third introduction of Lassa fever into urban Freetown.</S>
<S ID="13">(<COREF ID="X10">The first</COREF> was the DFID worker who later died in London).</S>
<S ID="14">This is the first case involving UN peacekeeping forces, many of whom are living in tents, in Lassa fever endemic areas, among rural Lassa fever <COREF ID="X11">virus</COREF>-carrying rodents.</S>
<S ID="15">We have no laboratory capacity to confirm the diagnosis, and have done no definitive <COREF ID="X12">investigation</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="16">(E.g.</S>
<S ID="17">: What is the intensity of exposure for UNAMSIL forces?</S>
<S ID="18">Have there been other sub-clinical/ undiagnosed cases?</S>
<S ID="19">Are there other more aggressive measures we should be taking, both for outsiders and for the resident population?)</S>
<S ID="20"><COREF ID="X13">I</COREF> would appreciate information and advice on the following:(1)How/where can I get some laboratory <COREF ID="X14">confirmation</COREF> for suspect cases?</S>
<S ID="21">(2)What are the options for sending possibly Lassa fever virus-infected laboratory specimens out of the country?</S>
<S ID="22">(3)Is the lab in Guinea operating?</S>
<S ID="23">(4)Has the time come to mount a full epidemiological investigation of this problem?</S>
<S ID="24">[Offers of help to Dr. Aldis as soon as possible.</S>
<S ID="25">Laboratory confirmation is essential.</S>
