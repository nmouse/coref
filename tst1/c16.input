<S ID="0">A Novel <COREF ID="X0">Pneumovirus</COREF> Isolated from <COREF ID="X1">Children</COREF> with Respiratory Tract Disease ------------------------------------------- .</S>
<S ID="1">In the current issue of "Nature Medicine," <COREF ID="X2">Bernadette G, van den Hoogen, Jan C. de Jong, Jan Goen, Thijs Kuiken, Ronald de Groot, Ron A.M. Fouchier and Albert D.M.E. Osterhaus</COREF> describe the <COREF ID="X3">isolation and characterisation</COREF> of a novel paramyxovirus from 28 children in <COREF ID="X4">the Netherlands</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="2">On the basis of virological data, sequence homology and genome organisation, this virus was identified tentatively as a new member of the genus _<COREF ID="X5">Metapneumovirus</COREF>_.</S>
<S ID="3">The only other known <COREF ID="X6">member</COREF> of this genus is the avian virus known as turkey rhinotracheitis virus [or avian pneumovirus].</S>
<S ID="4">Bernadette et al. have proposed the provisional name, human metapneumovirus, for this newly discovered human pathogen.</S>
<S ID="5">The clinical symptoms of the children from whom the virus was isolated were similar to those caused by <COREF ID="X7">human respiratory syncytial virus</COREF> <COREF ID="X8">infection</COREF>, ranging from upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia.</S>
<S ID="6">Serological studies showed that by the age of 5 years, virtually all children in the Netherlands have been exposed to human metapneumovirus and that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years.</S>
<S ID="7">[Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), a paramyxovirus which belongs to the genus _Pneumovirus_, is a universal respiratory pathogen which in temperate climates is the principal cause of hospitalisation of children in their first year of life, and which is now also considered to be a major cause of death in the elderly, rivalling influenza virus in this respect.</S>
<S ID="8">The isolation of a metapneumovirus (a related but distinct virus previously only thought to exist in birds) from children with bronchiolitis is a significant and surprising discovery.</S>
<S ID="9">A great deal of effort has gone into development of a vaccine to control HRSV infection in children, and the discovery of another apparently equally ubiquitous and serologically unrelated virus causing similar disease is unwelcome news.</S>
<S ID="10">It should be noted that turkey rhinotracheitis virus, the founder member of the genus _Metapneumovirus_, was considered for many years to be restricted to the Old World, because the immunological <COREF ID="X9">reagents</COREF> used for diagnosis did not react with strains of the virus now known to be present in the New World.</S>
<S ID="11">It may be that the widespread use of highly specific monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis of HRSV infection in children is one of the reasons why this human metapneumovirus was not detected sooner.</S>
