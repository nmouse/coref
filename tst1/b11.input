<S ID="11"><COREF ID="X0">BAYERISCHE MOTOREN WERKE AG</COREF>, or BMW, said parent-company sales rose 17% in <COREF ID="X1">1987</COREF>'s first 10 months, to 14.4 billion West German marks ($8.66 billion) from 12.3 billion marks <COREF ID="X2">a year earlier</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="12">The auto maker didn't disclose consolidated sales or earnings but predicted a rise in <COREF ID="X3">group sales</COREF> to about 19 billion marks in 1987 from 17.52 billion marks in 1986.</S>
<S ID="13">Moody's Investors Service Inc. placed <COREF ID="X4">the long-term debt</COREF> of <COREF ID="X5">DEN NORSKE CREDITBANK</COREF> under <COREF ID="X6">review for possible downgrading</COREF>, following the bank's announcement last Friday that it may have incurred trading losses of more than 600 million Norwegian kroner ($94.3 million) over the past month -- enough to wipe out 1987 net income -- partly through unauthorized dealing by an individual broker in the bank's own portfolio.</S>
<S ID="14">Moody's, which currently rates the long-term debt of Norway's largest bank double-A-3, said about $1.2 billion of debt is affected by the review.</S>
<S ID="15"><COREF ID="X7">DEUTSCHE GENOSSENSCHAFTS BANK</COREF> said it intends to acquire a majority stake in <COREF ID="X8">the trade union-owned insurance group VOLKSFUERSORGE</COREF> through <COREF ID="X9">an insurance concern it controls</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="16">The combination of Volksfuersorge and the insurance group R@amp;V ALLGEMEINE VERSICHERUNGS AG would form West Germany's second-largest retail-insurance concern.</S>
<S ID="17">A spokesman for <COREF ID="X10">the trade-union holding company</COREF> said it is likely to sell slightly more than 50% of Volksfuersorge.</S>
<S ID="18">LINDE AG said that group sales fell 6.7% in 1987's first nine months, to 2.56 billion West German marks ($1.54 billion) from 2.73 billion marks a year earlier, but that 1987 sales are expected to rise as much as 9% as the result of several large orders booked in the fourth quarter.</S>
<S ID="19">The machinery maker's earnings this year are likely to be "wholly satisfactory," Chairman Hans Meinhardt said.</S>
<S ID="20">Analysts expect domestic group profit to rise from last year's 106 million marks ($63.7 million).</S>
<S ID="21"><COREF ID="X11">NATIONALE NEDERLANDEN N.V.</COREF> said it expects to reach a definitive agreement "within the next few weeks" to sell <COREF ID="X12">MIDWESTERN UNITED LIFE INSURANCE CO., one of its U.S. subsidiaries,</COREF> to <COREF ID="X13">Ireland's largest insurer, </COREF>IRISH LIFE PLC.</S>
<S ID="22">The Netherlands' biggest insurance group said that Midwestern United duplicated the operations of one of its other U.S. units and that the Dutch concern hasn't changed its strategy of increasing its North American presence through expansion of existing subsidiaries and new acquisitions.</S>
