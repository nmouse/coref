<S ID="5">The Northwest Airlines flight attendants union said new wage and work rules the NWA Inc. unit has proposed are "unacceptable," and renewed a <COREF ID="X2">strike</COREF> threat.</S>
<S ID="6">Seeking to end a yearlong stalemate with the union, as previously reported, Northwest said Wednesday it plans unilaterally to impose new contract terms on the attendants April 1.</S>
<S ID="7">Union leaders complained Northwest is trying to "force a strike" and issued a statement advising passengers with reservations on Northwest over the <COREF ID="X3">Easter</COREF> holidays to "make other arrangements."</S>
<S ID="8">The union, a Teamsters chapter, invited <COREF ID="X4">leaders of the unions representing Northwest pilots and machinists</COREF> to a <COREF ID="X5">strategy meeting</COREF> Monday in Washington.</S>
<S ID="9"><COREF ID="X6">The Teamsters</COREF> have yet to win guarantees that the other unions would participate in a walkout.</S>
<S ID="10">An Air Line Pilots Association spokesman said union leaders haven't decided whether to attend the meeting.</S>
<S ID="11">A spokesman for the <COREF ID="X7">machinists</COREF>, Northwest's largest union, couldn't be reached for comment.</S>
<S ID="12"><COREF ID="X8">A Northwest spokesman</COREF> said management is "disappointed" by the union's threat to disrupt holiday service.</S>
<S ID="13">"We had hoped that if they didn't like the imposed (contract) policy, they would come back to bargaining table and get something better for themselves," he said.</S>
<S ID="14">The attendants union also called on the company's board to replace Chairman Steven G. Rothmeier with "competent management."</S>
