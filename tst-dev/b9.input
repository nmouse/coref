<S ID="10"><COREF ID="X2">Treasury Secretary James Baker</COREF> held <COREF ID="X3">a 7 1/2-hour negotiating session</COREF> with top Canadian officials, and <COREF ID="X4">the two sides</COREF> made progress toward possible resumption of talks on a free-trade pact.</S>
<S ID="11">"We have been reviewing all elements of the trade agreement, and we made a lot of progress today," Canadian Trade Minister <COREF ID="X5">Pat Carney</COREF> told reporters.</S>
<S ID="12">But she said a decision by <COREF ID="X6">Canada</COREF> on whether to resume the negotiations wouldn't come until after Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his cabinet have been briefed today.</S>
<S ID="13">Mr. Baker and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a statement that the daylong meeting was "a thorough discussion of all the elements involved in the negotiations."</S>
<S ID="14">They added, "We are hopeful that this will provide a basis for the negotiations to resume, and the <COREF ID="X7">U.S.</COREF> remains prepared to resume negotiations at any time."</S>
<S ID="15">Canada walked out of the talks last week, claiming that the U.S. had shown insufficient flexibility on Ottawa's main demand for a binding mechanism for settling trade disputes between the two countries.</S>
