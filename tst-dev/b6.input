<S ID="7">National Broadcasting Co. told <COREF ID="X3">its technicians and news employees union</COREF> that the network will put into effect next Monday its latest contract offer.</S>
<S ID="8">Union leaders said the move probably means <COREF ID="X4">the union's 2,800 NBC members</COREF> -- about a third of the company's work force -- will strike.</S>
<S ID="9">"It looks like we're going to be there on the street, unless there is a miracle," said <COREF ID="X5">John Krieger, </COREF>a spokesman for the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, which last struck NBC, a General Electric Co. unit, in 1976.</S>
<S ID="10">The possibility of a strike comes amid growing signs of a strike among members of the Directors Guild of America, whose talks with the three major networks on a contract to replace an agreement expiring June 30 appear to be stalling.</S>
<S ID="11">On Tuesday, a federal mediator brought NBC and the union together for the first time since the union's four-year contract expired March 31.</S>
<S ID="12">Both sides were deadlocked.</S>
<S ID="13">Areas of dispute include use of temporary workers at NBC, the length of the new contract and use of non-network news services.</S>
