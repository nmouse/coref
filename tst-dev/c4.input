<S ID="2">Chagas disease following organ transplantation has occurred in Latin America, where Chagas disease is endemic, but it has not yet been reported in <COREF ID="X3">the United States</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="3">A <COREF ID="X4">report</COREF> in the latest Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report &lt;http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5110a3.htm&gt; describes three <COREF ID="X5">cases</COREF> in the United States of _T. cruzi_ <COREF ID="X6">infection</COREF> associated with transplantation of solid <COREF ID="X7">organs</COREF> from the same <COREF ID="X8">donor</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="4"><COREF ID="X9">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</COREF> will collaborate with US transplant organizations to discuss whether to screen potential donors for _T. cruzi_ infection and, if so, which donors to screen, how to screen, and what to do if the screening tests are positive.</S>
<S ID="5">[Infection with _T. cruzi_ can be activated during immunosuppression in organ <COREF ID="X10">recipients</COREF> and can be transferred with the organ to the recipient.</S>
<S ID="6">The first situation is well known in countries where _T. cruzi_ is common, especially after bone marrow transplantation.</S>
<S ID="7">The second situation has been described several times after renal transplants where the kidney came from a _T. cruzi_ infected donor.</S>
<S ID="8">The three cases in the US all refer to organs from the same donor, and the comment on the CDC website emphasises that organ transplants save life and that medical personnel should be aware that Chagas disease is one of the possible risks associated with organ transplantation.</S>
