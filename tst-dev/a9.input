<S ID="10">Washington, Feb. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The <COREF ID="X4">Navy</COREF> ordered its Northrop Grumman Corp. F-14s out of the skies for <COREF ID="X5">three days</COREF> while it investigates three recent F-14 crashes.</S>
<S ID="11">The action came after an F-14A fighter crashed today in the <COREF ID="X6">Persian Gulf</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="12">The two crew members ejected and were rescued and returned to the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz with minor injuries, the Navy said.</S>
<S ID="13">Sunday, an F-14D crashed into the Pacific Ocean off southern California, killing its two crew members.</S>
<S ID="14">And on Jan. 29, an F-14A crashed into houses in Nashville, Tennessee, after takeoff, killing the two crew members and three people on the ground.</S>
<S ID="15">The cause of today's crash is undetermined.</S>
<S ID="16">``In light of the recent mishaps involving F-14As and Ds, the Navy has ordered <COREF ID="X7">a 72-hour safety standdown</COREF> for all F-14 aircraft,'' said <COREF ID="X8">Lt. Greg Geisen</COREF>, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon.</S>
<S ID="17">``Although different models of <COREF ID="X9">the F-14</COREF> have been involved in these mishaps, it is prudent to temporarily suspend routine flight operations for all F-14s in order to assess the available information and determine if procedural or other modifications to F-14 operations are warranted,'' the Navy said.</S>
<S ID="18">A one-time exception to the standdown will be allowed for <COREF ID="X10">14 F-14s on board the USS America</COREF>, which is returning to the United States from the Persian Gulf and Bosnia, Geisen said.</S>
<S ID="19">Those planes will be permitted to fly to Oceana Naval Air Station, Virginia, as the ship nears port.</S>
<S ID="20">The F14 ``Tomcat'' is the Navy's first-line fighter aircraft.</S>
<S ID="21">It has two-engines and is capable of action in all weather, day or night.</S>
<S ID="22">The Navy has about 330 F-14s in three models, As, Bs and Ds.</S>
<S ID="23">The models differ mainly in engines and avionics.</S>
<S ID="24">The A model uses engines from <COREF ID="X11">Pratt @amp; Whitney</COREF>, a unit of United Technologies Corp.</S>
<S ID="25">The B and D models use General Electric engines.</S>
<S ID="26">The Navy said there have been <COREF ID="X12">F-14 32 crashes since 1991</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="27">That figure isn't uncommon for Navy jet fighter aircraft, Geisen said.</S>
<S ID="28">The aircraft was introduced to the fleet in <COREF ID="X13">the mid 1970s</COREF>, and has undergone several upgrades since then, Geisen said.</S>
<S ID="29">The planes were made by <COREF ID="X14">Grumman Corp.</COREF>, now Northrop Grumman, principally in Calverton, New York, on Long Island.</S>
<S ID="30">The company delivered the last F-14 to the Navy in 1992, said <COREF ID="X15">Northrop Grumman spokesman John Vosilla</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="31">He referred all questions about today's crash to the Navy.</S>
<S ID="32">Aviation safety and engineering experts will review the data from the three recent crashes and are to present their findings to the Chief of Naval Operations Mike Boorda in three days, Geisen said.</S>
<S ID="33">Northrop Grumman shares were up 3/8 to 66 1/4 at midday.</S>
