<S ID="7">Eastern Airlines executives notified <COREF ID="X2">union</COREF> leaders that the carrier wishes to discuss selective <COREF ID="X3">wage reductions</COREF> on Feb. 3.</S>
<S ID="8"><COREF ID="X4">Union representatives who could be reached</COREF> said they hadn't decided whether they would respond.</S>
<S ID="9">By proposing a meeting date, Eastern moved one step closer toward reopening current high-cost contract agreements with its unions.</S>
<S ID="10">The proposal to meet followed an announcement Wednesday in which <COREF ID="X5">Philip Bakes</COREF>, Eastern's president, laid out proposals to cut wages selectively an average of 29%.</S>
<S ID="11">The airline's three major labor unions, whose contracts don't expire until year's end at the earliest, have vowed to resist the cuts.</S>
<S ID="12">Nevertheless, <COREF ID="X6">one union official</COREF> said he was intrigued by the brief and polite letter, which was hand-delivered by corporate security officers to the unions.</S>
<S ID="13">According to <COREF ID="X7">Robert Callahan</COREF>, president of Eastern's flight attendants union, the past practice of <COREF ID="X8">Eastern's parent</COREF>, Houston-based Texas Air Corp., has involved confrontation and ultimatums to unions either to accept the carrier's terms or to suffer the consequences -- in this case, perhaps, layoffs.</S>
<S ID="14">"Yesterday's performance was a departure," Mr. Callahan said, citing the invitation to conduct broad negotiations -- and the lack of a deadline imposed by management.</S>
<S ID="15">"Frankly, it's a little mystifying."</S>
