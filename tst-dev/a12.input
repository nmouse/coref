<S ID="10"><COREF ID="X5">SEATTLE</COREF> @amp;MD; The National Transportation Safety Board is borrowing a Boeing 737 from <COREF ID="X6">Seattle's Museum of Flight</COREF> as part of its investigation into why <COREF ID="X7">a similar jetliner</COREF> crashed near <COREF ID="X8">Pittsburgh</COREF> in 1994.</S>
<S ID="11">The museum's aircraft, ironically enough, was donated by USAir, which operated the airplane that crashed, killing 132 people on board.</S>
<S ID="12">The board is testing <COREF ID="X9">the plane's rudder</COREF> controls to learn why Flight 427 suddenly rolled and crashed while on its approach to the Pittsburgh airport Sept. 8, 1994.</S>
<S ID="13"><COREF ID="X10">Aviation safety investigators</COREF> say a sharp movement of <COREF ID="X11">the rudder</COREF> @amp;MD; the movable vertical piece in the plane's tail @amp;MD; could have caused the jet's deadly roll.</S>
<S ID="14"><COREF ID="X12">NTSB Chairman Jim Hall</COREF> is to address a briefing on the investigation in Seattle Thursday, but <COREF ID="X13">board spokesman Mike Benson</COREF> said Hall isn't expected to announce any findings.</S>
<S ID="15">Benson said investigators are simulating air loads on the 737's rudder.</S>
<S ID="16">``It's a slow, methodical job since we don't have adequate black boxes,'' he said.</S>
<S ID="17"><COREF ID="X14">Newer models of flight data recorders</COREF>, or ``black boxes,'' would record <COREF ID="X15">the angle of the rudder and the pedal controlling it</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="18">But because the plane was reduced to debris by the force of the crash, and the 737 was equipped with older-model flight recorders that didn't measure such information, investigators are running <COREF ID="X16">tests</COREF> to ``surmise'' rudder and pedal position, Benson said.</S>
<S ID="19">Installation of improved flight recorders was an official recommendation of the board after earlier hearings into the Pittsburgh crash.</S>
<S ID="20">Museum of Flight spokesman Bill Hayes said the plane, donated <COREF ID="X17">last September</COREF>, was to be partially dismantled as an exhibit.</S>
<S ID="21">The NTSB was looking for an intact plane on which to conduct tests, so the museum delayed its plans.</S>
<S ID="22">The tests are being conducted at a Boeing hangar at Boeing Field.</S>
<S ID="23">No airborne tests are planned.</S>
<S ID="24">The NTSB also conducted tests last September to determine if wake turbulence from another plane could have contributed to the crash.</S>
<S ID="25">Benson said those results are still being analyzed.</S>
