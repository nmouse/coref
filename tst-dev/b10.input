<S ID="8">A federal mediator is trying to reconcile the New York Stock Exchange and about 1,300 of its clerical and operations staff members, whose union contract expired Saturday night.</S>
<S ID="9">The mediator has imposed a news blackout on the two sides, so <COREF ID="X4">a Big Board spokesman</COREF> couldn't comment on the talks.</S>
<S ID="10">The spokesman did say that the exchange would be able to function normally in the event of a walkout.</S>
<S ID="11">The workers, members of the Office and Professional Employees International Union Local 153, work for the exchange; for Securities Industry Automation Corp., which operates the exchange's computers and of which the Big Board owns two-thirds; and for the <COREF ID="X5">New York Futures Exchange, </COREF>a unit of the Big Board.</S>
<S ID="12">Officials at the union and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service couldn't be reached for comment.</S>
<S ID="13">When the union's previous contract expired in October 1984, the union kept working for eight months without a contract until an agreement was reached in June 1985.</S>
