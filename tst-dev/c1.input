<S ID="1">A second infected area in East Anglia was declared free from classical swine fever (CSF) today and the relevant Infected Area Order has been revoked.</S>
<S ID="2"><COREF ID="X2">Pigs</COREF> can now be freely moved on and off about 160 farms previously in the Infected Area imposed around the <COREF ID="X3">Norfolk</COREF> breeding <COREF ID="X4">unit</COREF> where <COREF ID="X5">the outbreak</COREF> is believed to have originated.</S>
<S ID="3">It had been confirmed as infected on 9 August - the second of 15 premises to be confirmed with CSF following the <COREF ID="X6">start</COREF> of the outbreak on 8 Aug 2000.</S>
<S ID="4">The infected <COREF ID="X7">area</COREF> in north Essex was the first to be pronounced clear of the disease, and movement restrictions lifted on more than 90 farms there, on 22 Sep 2000.</S>
<S ID="5">The decision to lift the infected area was made following full veterinary investigation.</S>
<S ID="6">Similar investigations will be progressively undertaken in the other infected <COREF ID="X8">areas</COREF> with a view to lifting them as soon as possible.</S>
