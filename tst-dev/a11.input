<S ID="13">WASHINGTON @amp;MD; The U.S. Navy ordered all of its F-14s out of the skies for at least three days after <COREF ID="X5">one of them</COREF> crashed on <COREF ID="X6">Thursday</COREF> in <COREF ID="X7">the Persian Gulf</COREF>, the third crash of an F-14 in the last month.</S>
<S ID="14"><COREF ID="X8">The two-man crew</COREF> survived the crash, ejecting into the northern waters of the gulf, and were rescued and returned to <COREF ID="X9">the carrier Nimitz</COREF>.</S>
<S ID="15">The two crewmen, who were not identified, were reported to have suffered minor injuries.</S>
<S ID="16"><COREF ID="X10">The three-day shutdown</COREF> of the Navy's fleet of more than 330 F-14s was ordered by <COREF ID="X11">the chief of naval operations</COREF>, Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda, who said in an interview at the Pentagon that while there was no immediate evidence of a connection among the three crashes, ``This is an airplane that we worry about.''</S>
<S ID="17">``A jinxed airplane?''</S>
<S ID="18">he said.</S>
<S ID="19">``No.</S>
<S ID="20">But known deficiencies in <COREF ID="X12">the earlier models</COREF>?</S>
<S ID="21">Yes, and we're working on that, including some changes to the aircraft.''</S>
<S ID="22">He said the three-day review might result in new restrictions on use of the plane, nicknamed the Tomcat, which has the highest accident rate for jet fighters in the Navy fleet.</S>
<S ID="23">Ten F-14s have gone down in the past two years, and 32 since 1991.</S>
<S ID="24">Each plane costs more than $30 million.</S>
<S ID="25">``We may come out with some more operational restrictions, but it's way too early to say that,'' the admiral said.</S>
<S ID="26">``This is too serious a business to be guessing about.''</S>
<S ID="27"><COREF ID="X13">Navy officials</COREF> said that during the shutdown, special engineers and other safety experts would review the evidence available from the three recent crashes and inspect the rest of the fleet for defects in the planes, in their maintenance, or in pilot training.</S>
<S ID="28">Earlier models of the fighter, called the F-14A, were plagued with engine problems when they entered the Navy's fleet of carrier-based jet fighters in 1973.</S>
<S ID="29">Specifically, <COREF ID="X14">the engines</COREF> used on the first model were not powerful enough for a fighter of its size.</S>
<S ID="30">The Navy was forced to impose strict restrictions on how pilots could operate the aircraft, and had to replace many of the engines.</S>
<S ID="31"><COREF ID="X15">Two of the three planes that have crashed since late January</COREF> were F-14As.</S>
<S ID="32">The engines installed in <COREF ID="X16">later models</COREF>, the F-14B and the F-14D, were more powerful and have proved more reliable.</S>
<S ID="33">Despite the troubles of the F-14 fleet, the rate of accidents among all Navy fighter planes has come down dramatically in recent years, a record that has made the recent spate of crashes all the more alarming.</S>
<S ID="34">In the first of the crashes this year, an F-14A crashed into a residential neighborhood in Nashville, Tenn., on Jan. 29, seconds after takeoff.</S>
<S ID="35">The two-man crew was killed, along with three people on the ground.</S>
<S ID="36">The pilot was involved in another F-14 crash in 1995.</S>
<S ID="37">Last Sunday, the crew of <COREF ID="X17">an F-14D</COREF> was killed when the fighter plunged into the Pacific off the coast of Southern California during exercises.</S>
<S ID="38">The F-14 that crashed on Thursday had flown from the Nimitz, which is sailing in the Persian Gulf to enforce a no-fly zone over southern Iraq, an operation that dates from the end of the 1991 war in the gulf.</S>
<S ID="39">Navy officials said that the plane was on a routine training mission.</S>
<S ID="40">They would not speculate on the cause of the crash.</S>
<S ID="41">The plane, which was manufacutred by the Grumman Corp. of Long Island, has gone out of production, and the Navy has begun to phase out the plane entirely, replacing it with the F-18.</S>
